# Technical Labs

<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">

**Technical Labs has been suspended for the 2021/22 year. The content from last 
year is still available.**

Technical Labs is a series of labs being ran by Bath Computer Science Society 
(BCSS) intended to introduce useful technical skills.

These notes are intended to accompany in person labs covering the content in 
these labs.

Technical Labs is being led by [Alfie Richards](mailto:ar2227@bath.ac.uk) and 
[Joseph Cryer](mailto:jjc82@bath.ac.uk). Email us if you have any questions or 
want to get involved!

It was heavily inspired by the [Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu) 
series ran by MIT. We highly recommend these for those wanting more in depth 
content.

### Going beyond this series

This series is meant as an introduction to these concepts. The goal is to give 
an initial starting point, so that you can learn about them yourself and use 
them for your work!

Additionally, if you are a student at the University of Bath there are a lot of 
very knowledgable people on the [Bath Computer Science Discord 
server](https://discord.gg/gDYbrpK) who are  nomally happy to help with any CS 
questions you may have!

Many of these tools have incredible communities who write very in-depth tutorials and manuals 
which can normally be found easily.

### Trusting this series

We want you to feel confident in the information we are teaching. To accomplish this, our notes for 
these labs are being fact-checked by a variety of sources, including higher year 
students and lecturers.
