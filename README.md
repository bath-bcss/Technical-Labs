# Technical Labs

This is the repo with the source code for the BCSS Technical Labs ran 2020 - 2021.

To run this on `localhost` you first need to [install ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), [install jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), then [install bundler](http://bundler.io/).
You should then be able to run the website locally, by navigating to `/docs` and running the command `$ bundle exec jekyll serve`.
