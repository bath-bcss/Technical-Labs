Technical labs is a series of labs being run by Bath Computer Science Society (BCSS) intended to 
introduce useful technical skills.

This is being led by [Alfie Richards](mailto:ar2227@bath.ac.uk) and [Joe 
Cryer](mailto:jjc82@bath.ac.uk) email us if you have any questions or want to get involved!

It has been heavily inspired by the [Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu) series ran by 
MIT.

### What were covering

We aim to introduce:

- [The UNIX shell](UNIX_shell.md)
- Version control and Git
- Integrated development environment tools
- Debugging
- ssh
- Build automation software and 'make'
- Continuious intigration tools
- Deployment tools like docker, AWS, Azure, Heroku

### Going beyond this series

This series is only meant as an introduction to these concepts with the goal to give the insight so 
that you can go learn about them yourself and use them for your work!

This series was based off [Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu) from MIT which goes more 
in depth to a lot of these concepts and we hightly recommend.

Aditionally, if you are a student at the University of Bath there are a lot of very knowledgable 
people on the [Bath Computer Science discord server](https://discord.gg/gDYbrpK) who are normally 
happy to help with any CS questions you may have!

Also many of these tools have incredible communities who write very indepth tutorials and manuals 
which can normally be wfound with an search or two of your search engine of choice.

### Trusting this series

We are aiming to make this series as useful a resource as possible and so are getting out notes fact 
checked by a variety of sources to try make them as factual and useful as poossible.

The notes for this series have been researched and checked, we are aiming to have each note be 
checked by at least 1 lecturer.
