Advanced Labs is a series of labs that are designed to teach people (specifically freshers) about
data structures and algorithms. 

This is being led by [Samuel Guard](mailto:sg2268@bath.ac.uk) and [Joe 
Cryer](mailto:jjc82@bath.ac.uk) email us if you have any questions or want to get involved!

We are both students currently in our second year of the Computer Science course, we we're inspired
by Arthur Baker to carry on these labs as we really enjoyed them.

### Who is this for

This is for anyone who wants to challenge themselves, although some information will be assumed such
as (these are NOT requirements, so if you're unsure come along anyways):
- Knowing how to program in Python, C, Java or any widely used language
- A level computer science knowledge or something similar

### What were covering

As this is early on we do not have a complete list of all the topics we would like to cover but here
is a brief overview of what we have planned:
- Big O and Complexity
- Data structures
- Searching and Sorting
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
