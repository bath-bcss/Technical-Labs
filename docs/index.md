Technical Labs are a series of labs being run by Bath Computer Science Society (BCSS) intended to 
introduce useful technical skills.

These notes are coupled with a video series you can find 
[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT4sucrjsqF8kvZFcRvxfhWuTvjKrXYzE).

This is being led by [Alfie Richards](mailto:ar2227@bath.ac.uk) and [Joseph 
Cryer](mailto:jjc82@bath.ac.uk). Email us if you have any questions or want to get involved!

It has been heavily inspired by the [Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu) series ran by 
MIT. We highly recommend you watch these as a follow-up to these labs, as they go much more in-depth
on some of these concepts.

### What we have covered

1. [The Unix shell](Unix_Shell.html)
2. [Git pt 1, the basics](git.html)
3. [Git pt 2, remotes and GitHub](git_pt_2.html)
4. [Jetbrains IDEs and IntelliJ](jetbrains_ide.html)

### What we aim to cover

- Debugging
- ssh
- Build automation software and 'make'
- Continuous integration tools
- Deployment tools like Docker, AWS, Azure, Heroku

### Going beyond this series

This series is only meant as an introduction to these concepts. The goal is to give an initial 
starting point, so that you can learn about them yourself and use them for your work!

Additionally, if you are a student at the University of Bath there are a lot of very knowledgable 
people on the [Bath Computer Science Discord server](https://discord.gg/gDYbrpK) who are always 
happy to help with any CS questions you may have!

Many of these tools have incredible communities who write very in-depth tutorials and manuals 
which can normally be found easily.

### Trusting this series

We want you to feel confident in the information we are teaching. To accomplish this, our notes for 
these labs are being fact-checked by a variety of sources, including higher year students and 
lecturers.
